# API Practice App.

With this, I want to practise using the Fetch API to grab some data, then output the results.

Initially I started using the fetch API, I've then changed this to use Async/Await.

I have then assigned the data to update the DOM with the information returned.

I've then added some basic styling (my styling skills aren't great by anyones standards :P).
